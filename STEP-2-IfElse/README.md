# STEP 2: Conditional Statements (If-Else)

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates the usage of conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`). Your program should:

- Prompt the user to enter an integer number.
- Use conditional statements to determine and print whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Handle all possible cases using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

### Example

For example, if the user enters:
- `10`: Output should be "Positive number".
- `-5`: Output should be "Negative number".
- `0`: Output should be "Zero".

## Instructions

1. Open `if_else.cpp` and implement the required functionality based on the problem description.
2. Use `cin` to read user input and `cout` to print the result based on the conditions.
3. Test your program with different input values (positive, negative, zero) to verify correctness.
4. Ensure your program handles all edge cases, such as input validation for non-integer inputs.

Feel free to enhance your program with additional features or refinements beyond the basic requirements.

Happy coding!
