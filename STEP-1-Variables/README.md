# STEP 1: Variables and Data Types

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates basic variable declaration and usage. Your program should:
- Declare variables of different data types (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`).
- Initialize these variables with sample values.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Print the results of these operations.

### Example

For example, your program might output:
```
Integer: 10
Float: 3.14
Double: 5.6789
Character: A
Boolean: true
Sum: 13.8189
Difference: 6.8211
Product: 31.4894
Quotient: 1.58732
```


## Instructions

1. Open `variables.cpp` and implement the required functionality based on the problem description.
2. You can create additional files for testing or organizing your code.
3. Test your program with different input values and verify that it produces correct outputs.
4. Feel free to explore additional features or enhancements beyond the basic requirements.

Happy coding!
