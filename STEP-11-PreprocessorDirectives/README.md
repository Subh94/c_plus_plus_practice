# STEP 11: Preprocessor Directives

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates the usage of preprocessor directives. Your program should:

- Define macros using `#define` and use them for simple text replacement or conditional compilation.
- Use include guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) to prevent multiple header file inclusions.
- Demonstrate conditional compilation using `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#else`, and `#endif` directives.

### Example

For example, your program might:
- Define a macro `#define PI 3.14159` for defining the value of pi.
- Use include guards in header files to ensure they are included only once during compilation.

## Instructions

1. Open `preprocessor_directives.cpp` and implement the required preprocessor directives based on the problem description.
2. Use macros to simplify code maintenance and conditional compilation to enable/disable specific code sections.
3. Test your program by compiling with different preprocessor definitions to observe their effects on program behavior.
4. Explore additional preprocessor directives, such as `#pragma`, to control compiler behavior or improve code readability.

Feel free to experiment with macro definitions and conditional compilation strategies to optimize your C++ programs and improve code maintainability.

Happy coding!
