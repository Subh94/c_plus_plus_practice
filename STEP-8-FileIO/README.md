# STEP 8: File Input and Output (I/O)

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates file input and output operations. Your program should:

- Read data from an input file (`input.txt`), process the data, and write results to an output file (`output.txt`).
- Implement error handling to manage file opening, reading, and writing operations.
- Use `fstream` objects (`ifstream`, `ofstream`) to handle file input and output securely.

### Example

For example, your program might:
- Read a list of numbers from `input.txt`, compute their sum, and write the result to `output.txt`.
- Implement error checking to handle cases where input file is missing or cannot be opened.

## Instructions

1. Open `file_io.cpp` and implement the required file handling operations based on the problem description.
2. Use `ifstream` to read data from input files and `ofstream` to write results to output files.
3. Test your program with different input scenarios to ensure correct reading and writing operations.
4. Explore additional features of file I/O, such as binary file operations or file stream manipulators (`setw`, `setprecision`).

Feel free to enhance your program with additional file processing features or error handling mechanisms to improve robustness and reliability.

Happy coding!
