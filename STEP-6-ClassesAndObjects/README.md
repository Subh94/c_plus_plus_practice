# STEP 6: Classes and Objects

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts with classes and objects. Your program should:

- Define a class representing a real-world entity or concept (e.g., `Car`, `Student`, `Employee`).
- Implement member variables (attributes) and member functions (methods) within the class to represent and manipulate object state.
- Create instances (objects) of the class and demonstrate their usage by accessing member variables and invoking member functions.

### Example

For example, your program might:
- Define a `Car` class with attributes like `make`, `model`, `year`, and methods to set/get these attributes.
- Create objects of the `Car` class and demonstrate how to initialize object state and manipulate it using member functions.

## Instructions

1. Open `classes_and_objects.cpp` and implement the required class definition and member functions based on the problem description.
2. Use constructor(s), accessor methods (getters/setters), and other class features to manage object state and behavior.
3. Test your program by creating multiple objects of the class and performing operations on them.
4. Explore additional features of object-oriented programming, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, as you progress.

Feel free to extend your program with inheritance, polymorphism, or other advanced OOP concepts to deepen your understanding and skills.

Happy coding!
