# STEP 12: Basic Algorithms and Data Structures

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that implements basic algorithms and data structures. Your program should:

- Implement fundamental algorithms like sorting (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort) and searching (e.g., linear search, binary search).
- Define data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, or trees and implement operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) on them.
- Demonstrate the use of algorithms and data structures to solve common problems or optimize program performance.

### Example

For example, your program might:
- Implement a bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
- Define a linked list data structure and implement operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Instructions

1. Open `algorithms_and_data_structures.cpp` and implement the required algorithms and data structures based on the problem description.
2. Test your implementations with sample data to verify correctness and efficiency.
3. Use algorithmic techniques (divide and conquer, dynamic programming) to optimize performance for specific problems.
4. Explore additional algorithms (recursion, graph algorithms) and data structures (hash tables, heaps) to expand your knowledge and skills.

Feel free to challenge yourself with complex problems and explore advanced algorithms and data structures to enhance your proficiency in C++ programming.

Happy coding!
