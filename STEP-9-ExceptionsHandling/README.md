# STEP 9: Exceptions Handling

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates exception handling techniques. Your program should:

- Implement try-catch blocks to handle runtime errors or exceptional situations, such as division by zero.
- Use `throw` statements to raise custom exceptions and `catch` blocks to handle them gracefully.
- Ensure that your program provides informative error messages and handles exceptions without terminating abruptly.

### Example

For example, your program might:
- Divide two numbers entered by the user and handle cases where the divisor is zero using try-catch blocks.
- Define custom exception classes and throw them based on specific error conditions.

## Instructions

1. Open `exceptions_handling.cpp` and implement the required exception handling mechanisms based on the problem description.
2. Use `try`, `catch`, and `throw` statements to manage runtime errors and exceptional conditions.
3. Test your program with different input values to ensure that exceptions are caught and handled correctly.
4. Explore additional features of exception handling, such as nested try-catch blocks or exception specifications (`throw()`).

Feel free to refine your error handling strategy and implement defensive programming techniques to improve the reliability of your C++ programs.

Happy coding!
