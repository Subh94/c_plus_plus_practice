# C++ Practice Repository

Welcome to the C++ Practice Repository! This repository contains a series of practice problems to help you refresh and strengthen your C++ programming skills. Each step corresponds to a fundamental concept of C++ programming.

## Structure

The repository is organized into branches, each focusing on a specific topic or concept:

- `STEP-1-Variables`: Basic variable declaration and usage.
- `STEP-2-IfElse`: Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`).
- `STEP-3-Functions`: Function declaration, definition, and usage.
- `STEP-4-ArraysAndStrings`: Arrays and strings manipulation.
- `STEP-5-PointersAndReferences`: Pointers and references in C++.
- `STEP-6-ClassesAndObjects`: Object-oriented programming with classes and objects.
- `STEP-7-InheritanceAndPolymorphism`: Inheritance and polymorphism in C++.
- `STEP-8-FileIO`: File input and output operations.
- `STEP-9-ExceptionsHandling`: Exception handling in C++.
- `STEP-10-Templates`: Generic programming with templates.
- `STEP-11-PreprocessorDirectives`: Using preprocessor directives in C++.
- `STEP-12-BasicAlgorithmsAndDataStructures`: Implementing basic algorithms and data structures.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Create your own branch**: Create your own branch for practice from master.

3. **Read the Problem Description**: Open the `README.md` file in the step folder to understand the problem statement and any specific requirements.

4. **Implement Your Solution**: Use the starter code provided in the `step_name.cpp` file to implement your solution. You can create additional files if necessary for testing or organization.

5. **Test Your Solution**: Create test cases to validate your solution against expected outputs. You can modify the provided `test.cpp` file or create your own.

6. **Submit Your Solution**: Once you've completed the challenge, you can merge your branch back into `master` or create a pull request if collaborating with others.
