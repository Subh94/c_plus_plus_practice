# STEP 5: Pointers and References

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates the usage of pointers and references. Your program should:

- Define variables and pointers of different data types (`int`, `float`, `double`).
- Initialize pointers to point to the addresses of variables and use pointer dereferencing to access and modify variable values.
- Implement functions that use references (`&` operator) to modify variable values directly.

### Example

For example, your program might:
- Define an `int` variable and a pointer to that variable. Use the pointer to modify the variable's value.
- Implement a function that takes a reference to an `int` and modifies its value directly.

## Instructions

1. Open `pointers_and_references.cpp` and implement the required functionality based on the problem description.
2. Use pointer arithmetic and dereferencing to manipulate variable values.
3. Test your program with different scenarios to ensure correct behavior, especially with memory addresses and pointer operations.
4. Explore additional pointer and reference features, such as null pointers, pointer to pointer, or passing pointers/references to functions.

Feel free to experiment and learn more about memory management and efficient data access using pointers and references in C++.

Happy coding!
