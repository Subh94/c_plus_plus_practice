# STEP 4: Arrays and Strings

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates the usage of arrays and strings. Your program should:

- Define an array of integers or strings and initialize it with sample values.
- Implement basic operations such as accessing elements, modifying elements, and iterating through the array.
- Manipulate C-style strings (`char[]`) or `std::string` objects with operations like concatenation, substring extraction, or string comparison.

### Example

For example, your program might:
- Define an array of integers and print each element using a loop.
- Manipulate a `std::string` object to concatenate two strings and print the result.

## Instructions

1. Open `arrays_and_strings.cpp` and implement the required functionality based on the problem description.
2. Use loops and array/string operations to perform the required tasks.
3. Test your program with different input values to ensure correctness and functionality.
4. Explore additional features or enhancements to deepen your understanding of arrays and strings in C++.

Feel free to experiment with different array sizes, string lengths, and operations to expand your knowledge and skills.

Happy coding!
