# STEP 7: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism concepts. Your program should:

- Define a base class and one or more derived classes that inherit from the base class.
- Implement virtual functions and override them in derived classes to demonstrate polymorphic behavior.
- Create instances of derived classes and use them polymorphically to invoke overridden methods.

### Example

For example, your program might:
- Define a base class `Shape` with a virtual function `calculateArea()`. Derive classes `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` that override `calculateArea()` with their respective formulas.
- Create objects of each derived class and use them polymorphically to compute and print their areas.

## Instructions

1. Open `inheritance_and_polymorphism.cpp` and implement the base class, derived classes, and virtual functions based on the problem description.
2. Use dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`) to create objects of derived classes and demonstrate polymorphic behavior.
3. Test your program to ensure that overridden functions are correctly invoked based on the object type at runtime.
4. Explore additional features of inheritance, like protected members, and polymorphism, such as pure virtual functions and abstract classes.

Feel free to experiment with different inheritance hierarchies and polymorphic behaviors to deepen your understanding of object-oriented programming in C++.

Happy coding!
