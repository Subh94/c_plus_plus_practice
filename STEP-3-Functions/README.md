# STEP 3: Functions

## Problem Description

Create a C++ program that demonstrates the usage of functions. Your program should:

- Define multiple functions to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Implement function overloading by defining functions with the same name but different parameter types.
- Test each function with sample inputs to ensure correctness and functionality.

### Example

For example, your program might define the following functions:
- `int add(int a, int b)` to add two integers.
- `float add(float a, float b)` to add two floats.
- Similarly, define functions for subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Instructions

1. Open `functions.cpp` and implement the required functions based on the problem description.
2. Test each function by calling them with different sample inputs and printing the results.
3. Use `cout` statements to verify that each function produces the correct output for various data types and scenarios.
4. Explore function overloading to handle different parameter types and validate the behavior.

Feel free to expand your program with additional functions or features to enhance your understanding of function declarations, definitions, and overloading in C++.

Happy coding!
